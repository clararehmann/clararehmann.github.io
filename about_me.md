title: About me
---

I'm Clara! I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in the [Kern Ralph Co-Lab](https://kr-colab.github.io/) at the University of Oregon. 
I mostly code in Python and am raising a bearded dragon named [Aeg](https://clararehmann.github.io/etc/aeg_page). 
When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy making art, going to shows, and being outside.

# Research
I'm primarily interested in studying geographic patterns of genetic variation, and I have a soft spot for infectious disease. 
I use simulation, statistics, and machine learning to make sense of the evolutionary forces that underlie real data.
My current projects center around identifying geographic signatures of co-dispersal and selective sweeps in the *Anopheles*-*Plasmodium* system.
More generally, I am interested using geographic and genetic data to better understand host-parasite dynamics.

# Other stuff

I've been on the board of [UO Women in Graduate Science](blogs.uoregon.edu/uowgs) for three years
(and am currently President!).
I love population genetics and it's important to me to help make the field and science in general more inclusive
and accessible.
