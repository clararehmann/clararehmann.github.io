I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Kern Ralph Co-Lab](https://kr-colab.github.io/) at the University of Oregon. 
I mostly code in Python and am raising a bearded dragon named [Aeg](https://clararehmann.github.io/etc/aeg_page) (pronounced like what he came out of). 
When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy making art, going to shows, and being outside.

# Research
I'm primarily interested in studying geographic patterns of genetic variation, and I have a soft spot for infectious disease (especially vector-borne and zoonotic ones). 
In my research, I use simulation, statistics, and machine learning to make sense of the evolutionary forces that underlie genetic data.
My current projects center around identifying geographic signatures of [co-dispersal](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae008) and [selective sweeps](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf141) in the *Anopheles*-*Plasmodium* system.
More generally, I am interested using geographic and genetic data to better understand host-parasite dynamics.

# Other stuff

I've been on the board of [UO Women in Graduate Science](blogs.uoregon.edu/uowgs) for four years and am also involved in 
[GrEBES](blogs.uoregon.edu/grebes), the graduate student group for my department.
I think population genetics is super neat and it's important to me to help make the field (and science in general) more inclusive
and accessible.
