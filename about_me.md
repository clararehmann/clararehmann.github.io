I'm Clara! I'm a third-year PhD candidate in the [Kern Ralph Co-Lab](https://kr-colab.github.io/) at the University of Oregon. 
I have a bearded dragon named Aeg, but I mostly code in Python. When I'm off my computer, I enjoy making art, seeing live music, and being outside.

**Research**  I'm primarily interested in studying geographic patterns of genetic variation, and I have a soft spot for infectious disease. 
I use simulation, statistics, and machine learning to make sense of the evolutionary forces that underlie real data.
My current projects center around identifying geographic signatures of co-dispersal and selective sweeps in the *Anopheles*-*Plasmodium* system.
More generally, I am interested using geographic and genetic data to better understand host-parasite dynamics.
